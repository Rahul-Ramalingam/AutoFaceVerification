## Further Enhancement

### Areas Needed Enhancement

#### Card Verification:
For card verification a image similarity model is used. This can be further enhanced using a SVM classifier or other ml or dl models

#### Card Detection:
For now , User is asked to place the card in a particular location for card verification. This can be automated by using a state of art object detection models
          like yolo, resnet etc..The models can be trained using transfer learning and can be used for detection
